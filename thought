We can't control both the width and height if we allow an arbitary string?

So we will throw an error if height and width are specified and the string doesn't fit?

Else we let width be specified and the keep adding lines to the maze?

We need to have the width and height of letters in order to do these calculations, we can write a quick script to figure that out

Ok so steps:

1. Fix how we add letters so the maze still works
2. Allow multiple letters to be added
3. Make width and height checks
